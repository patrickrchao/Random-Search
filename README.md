This repository is an implementation and investigation on the basic random search algorithm from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07055.pdf.
You may run the scripts to generate plots, or type ```python3 RandomSearchAdagrad.py -h``` or ```python3 StepSizeSearch.py``` for help.

A detailed write up describing the methods and analysis is in the pdf file.
