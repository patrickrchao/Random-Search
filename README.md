This repository is an implementation and investigation on the basic random search 
algorithm from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07055.pdf.
You may run the scripts ```./RandomSearch.sh``` or ```./StepSizeSearch.sh```
 to generate plots or type ```python3 main.py -h``` for help.

An elementary write up describing the methods and analysis is in the pdf file.
